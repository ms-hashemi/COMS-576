HW1-General forward search algorithm and Path planning with 2D grid

How to run:
All necessary codes have been uploaded in the current directory. A few additional Python library have been used for task 1 
in "discrete_search.py" code. These libraries are basic and most probably inculded within a basic Python installation.

To run the package, the main python script "hw1.py" should be run with the required arguments of the 2D-grid space ".json" file,
the type of search algorithm (strings of "bfs", "dfs", or "astar") for path planning precedded by the flag "--alg", and the desired 
output "json" file precedded by the flag "--alg". So, a typical command to run the package and get a result should look like the following:

python hw1.py hw1_grid.json --alg bfs --out hw1_bfs.json

I have saved the dictionary results of each algorithm given the specific search problem of the assignment. The expected results have
the suffix of "_solution" in their file names. BFS and DFS solutions of mine are the same, but ASTAR lead to a different result as 
the specific implementation may differ. Nevertheless, I think the alggorithm for ASTAR has been implemented correctly in my code.
